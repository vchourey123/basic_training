Web Assignement : 

-  I’ve created postman id , used to to check http request and implementations .
- Used pipedream SWAPI documentation to learn how particular requests are send .
- Used swapi link on given code to access all links and perform get method on that .
- Applied get method on characters , species and all subcategories . As only three methods could be implemented on these links i.e , Get, Head and Option .
- Used documentation and used dummy link of jsonplaceholder for application of CRUD operations using GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods .

- A request contains body , headers, query strings and versions.
-A response conatins Protocol version , status code , status text based on status code and Headers .  Response may also contain body .

    • GET :  
              We  use GET to read or retrieve a resource . A successful GET resturns the response containing info you need .
    • POST :
	We use POST to create a new resource . A POST request requires a body in which you define data of the entity to be created . 
    • PUT :
              We use PUT to modify  a resource . PUT updates the data or adds depending on request provided. 
    • DELETE : 
                  We use delete to delete a resource .

- HTTP response status codes :
    1. Informational response (100 - 199)
    2. Successful response (200 - 299)
    3. Redirection message (300 - 399)
    4. Client error response (400 - 499)
    5. Server error response (500-599)
